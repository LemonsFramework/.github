lemons is a game framework that's built on haxe that provides.. well what a game framework should, a framework to build your games on


lemons is split into two parts:
- [lemons](https://github.com/LemonsFramework/lemons) [the main library that you're going to include in your project]
- [lemontree](https://github.com/LemonsFramework/lemontree) [the native code for parts of the framework like sound, video, etc...]

also if you haven't noticed yet, this library is hevily unfinished as of now, so creating pull requests and reporting issues is greatly appreciated

oh, by the way lemons is always spelt lowercase
